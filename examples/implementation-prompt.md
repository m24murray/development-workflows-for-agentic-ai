# Implementation prompt
There is a file called `spec.md` at the root of this project that includes a detailed specification for a node app that I want to build. 

I want you to break it down into small, iterative pieces that you can implement. This should be output to a file called `implementation-plan.md` 

Each iteration should list a set of detailed prompts of what should be done to help facilitate the implementation. Each iteration must fit in with what has come before it and there should be no orphaned code.
