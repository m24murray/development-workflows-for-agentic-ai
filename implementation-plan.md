# Java Spring REST API Implementation Guide

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of the API specified in `spec.md`. Each section represents a single development iteration, following Test-Driven Development principles.

## Iteration 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure
**Status:**  
Completed

**What we'll implement:**
- Initialize a Spring Boot project with Gradle
- Configure MongoDB connection
- Set up basic project structure following package-by-feature organization
- Create the User data model
- Implement health check using Spring Boot Actuator
- 
**Completed Implementation:**
- Set up a Spring Boot project with Gradle using Java 21
- Added Lombok to reduce boilerplate code
- Implemented Spring Boot Actuator for health checks at `/api/v1/health`
- Created MongoDB configuration
- Implemented the User model with proper validation
- Added comprehensive test cases for the User model
- Configured logback for structured JSON logging

## Iteration 2: User Repository Layer
**Status**: Completed

**What we'll implement:**
- Create the MongoDB repository for User entities
- Implement custom repository methods for case-insensitive email handling
- Write unit tests for the repository layer
- 
**Completed Implementation:**
- Created UserRepository interface extending MongoRepository<User, UUID>
- Added methods for case-insensitive email matching:
  - findByEmailIgnoreCase() to find users by email regardless of case
  - existsByEmailIgnoreCase() to check if an email already exists
- Created custom repository interface and implementation for specialized operations:
  - isEmailUnique() to verify email uniqueness with an option to exclude a specific user
  - findByExactEmail() for exact case-sensitive email matching
- Wrote comprehensive test cases:
  - Unit tests for the custom repository implementation
  - Integration tests for the repository interface methods
  - Used Mockito to mock MongoDB interactions

**Actual cost:** $0.30

## Iteration 3: User Service Layer
**Status**: Completed

**What we'll implement:**
- Create the service layer for handling business logic
- Implement CRUD operations in the service
- Add validation logic for user input
- Write unit tests for the service layer


**Completed Implementation:**
- Created a set of common exceptions for error handling:
  - ResourceNotFoundException for when requested resources don't exist
  - DuplicateResourceException for email uniqueness violations
  - BadRequestException for invalid input data
- Created UserService interface with well-defined operations:
  - getUserById(), getAllUsers(), createUser()
  - updateUser(), patchUser(), deleteUser()
  - existsByEmail(), getUserByEmail()
- Implemented UserServiceImpl with:
  - Proper validation of inputs
  - Email uniqueness checks
  - Structured error handling
  - Logging for all operations
- Wrote comprehensive tests covering:
  - All successful operations
  - Edge cases and error conditions
  - Validation logic
  - Email uniqueness constraints

**Actual cost:** $0.40

## Iteration 4: User Controller - Read Operations
**Status**: Completed

**What we'll implement:**
- Create the REST controller for User endpoints
- Implement GET endpoint for retrieving users by ID
- Implement GET endpoint for retrieving all users or search by email
- Set up error handling for common scenarios
- Write unit and integration tests

**Completed Implementation:**
- Created UserController with base path `/api/v1/users`
- Implemented REST-compliant endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/users/{id}` to retrieve a user by ID
  - `GET /api/v1/users` to retrieve all users
  - `GET /api/v1/users?email=...` to search for a user by email
- Added proper exception handling for 404 Not Found scenarios
- Documented API with OpenAPI annotations for Swagger
- Implemented comprehensive tests:
  - Unit tests for all endpoints using MockMvc
  - Integration tests to verify endpoint behavior
  - Test cases for both success and error scenarios

**Actual cost:** $0.35

## Iteration 5: User Controller - Write & Update Operations
**Status**:  
Completed

**What we'll implement:**
- POST endpoint for creating users
- PUT endpoint for full updates
- PATCH endpoint for partial updates 
- Common validation for all write operations

**Completed Implementation:**
- Added POST endpoint for creating users with proper validation
- Implemented PUT endpoint for full user updates
- Added PATCH endpoint for partial user updates
- Created customized ObjectMapper for proper ObjectId serialization
- Added comprehensive test cases for all endpoints
- Implemented proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Properly documented endpoints with OpenAPI annotations

**Actual cost:** $0.30

## Iteration 6: User Controller - Delete Operation
**Status**:  
Completed

**What we'll implement:**
- DELETE endpoint for removing users
- Proper HTTP status code handling

**Completed Implementation:**
- Implemented DELETE endpoint with proper HTTP status codes
- Added comprehensive test cases for the endpoint
- Properly documented the endpoint with OpenAPI annotations
- Ensured proper validation and error handling

**Actual cost:** $0.20

## Iteration 7: API Documentation, Logging & Final Polish
**Status**:  
Completed

**What we'll implement:**
- OpenAPI documentation with Springdoc
- JSON structured logging
- Final integration tests and cleanup

**Completed Implementation:**
- Configured OpenAPI documentation with Springdoc and interactive Swagger UI
- Added detailed OpenAPI annotations to all controller endpoints
- Implemented request/response logging for debugging with a custom filter
- Set up structured JSON logging with Logback
- Verified our implementation against all specification requirements
- Updated the README with complete documentation of the API
- Ensured the codebase follows the package-by-feature structure

**Actual cost:** $0.25
